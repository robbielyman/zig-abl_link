* zig-abl_link

=zig-abl_link= is a Zig interface to [[https://ableton.com][Ableton]]'s [[https://github.com/Ableton/link][Link]] library.
=zig-abl_link= provides Zig types for Link primitives.

To add this package to your project, you can run this code:

#+begin_src bash
$ zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/robbielyman/zig-abl_link
#+end_src

Then in your =build.zig= you can add this:

#+begin_src zig
const zig_link = b.dependency("abl_link", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});

// For whatever you're building; in this case let's assume its root module is `root_module`
root_module.addImport("ziglink", zig_link.module("zig-abl_link"));
#+end_src

and in your source code:

#+begin_src zig
// import
const lk = @import("ziglink");

// and use it something link this
const link = lk.Link.create() orelse return error.Failed;
defer link.destroy();
const state = lk.SessionState.create() orelse return error.Failed;
defer state.destroy();
state.captureFromApplicationThread(link);
defer state.commitFromApplicationThread(link);
_ = state.isPlaying();
#+end_src

** Dependencies

To use =zig-abl_link=, you must have the ASIO library installed on your system
and accessible for compilers to link against.
On macOS, for example, you can accomplish this by running =brew install asio=.
On Linux, consult your package manager.

Building ASIO from source is out of scope for this particular package,
but if you have a Zig package for doing so, please reach out;
I'd love to make this library depend on yours.
